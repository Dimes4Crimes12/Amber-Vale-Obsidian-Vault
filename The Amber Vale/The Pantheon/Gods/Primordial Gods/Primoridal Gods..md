Primordial gods are gods which existed before the birth of the sapient races, coming animalistic instincts and natural laws. These gods hold the greatest power among the pantheon and are the most likely to gift boons to their most devout followers.



The worship of these gods is outlawed within [[The Secastian Empire]]
