The Sainted or "Saints" is a title given to a person upon passing both the following criteria.
- Live in service or with the intention of serving a legal god
- Has performed at least two miracles attributed to them within their life or after their death.

Miracles are major acts of selflessness or power with at least 3 witnessess to their occurance. Examples would include slaying a great monster, saving hundreds of lives or completing a task of great importance. 

Most saints were religious earlier in life and worked in service to a specific god for decades to earn their favour, but others were polytheistic and gained the blessing of a god who liked them the most.


After a person is officially named as a saint they often recieve visions from their patron, asking them to perform a task or journey to assist the pantheon on the Ethereal plane.
