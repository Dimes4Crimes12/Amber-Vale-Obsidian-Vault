*A warning message forged for Daedrath, this weapon takes facets from the bearer as its destructive power is unleashed.*


This weapon is a greatsword and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

While attuned, your rages last twice as long and you additionally gain resistance to cold, fire, lightning and radiant damage.

Whenever you take bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage while attuned to this weapon you must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If failed, you go into a blind frenzy for 1 minute and must spend your movement and action to move to the nearest creature to you. When you reach melee range of the nearest creature you must spend all actions and bonus actions attacking that creature with this weapon until they fall unconscious.

After the effect ends, roll a d8 to determine what facet you lose.
